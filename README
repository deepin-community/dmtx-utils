             dmtx-utils README file (all platforms)

This summary of the dmtx-utils package applies generally to all
platforms. For instructions regarding your specific platform
please also read the README.xxx file in this directory that
matches your system (e.g., README.linux, README.cygwin,
README.osx, etc...).


1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx is a software library that enables programs to read and
write Data Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. This
package, dmtx-utils, provides command line utilities that allow
scripts and command line users to use libdmtx functionality.


2. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In theory the following 3 steps will compile and install libdmtx
on your system:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

However, you may need to install additional software for these
steps to work properly. Details are provided below to handle
error messages or if you want to customize beyond the defaults.

Details on "configure" step
----------------------------------------
If you obtained libdmtx from Git you may have received an error
like "./configure: No such file or directory". Run this command
and try again:

  $ ./autogen.sh

The autogen.sh command requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and
pkgconfig to be installed on your system.

Also, if you built and installed the libdmtx library from source
it's like that configure gave you an error similar to this:

  configure: error: dmtxread/dmtxwrite requires libdmtx >= 0.7.0

You can fix this by telling configure where to find libdmtx.pc:

  $ ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

Note: This path may be different on your system.

Details on "make" step
----------------------------------------
Errors encountered during the "make" step are often a result of
missing software dependencies. Install any missing software and
try again.

Details on "sudo make install" step
----------------------------------------
If the 'sudo' command is not configured on your system then
alternatively you can yell "Yeeehaww!" as you log in as root and
run this instead:

  $ make install


3. Basic Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

New users are encouraged to read the man pages for the library
and command line utilities. However, here are a few simple cases
to get you started:

The dmtxwrite utility turns a message into a barcode image. The
message is passed to dmtxwrite via file or standard input, and
the output image is written to file or standard output. The
following examples all produce an equivalent result:

  $ echo -n 123456 | dmtxwrite > image.png
  $ echo -n 123456 | dmtxwrite -o image.png
  $ echo -n 123456 > mesg.txt; dmtxwrite mesg.txt > image.png
  $ dmtxwrite <(echo -n 123456) -o image.png

Conversely, the dmtxread utility turns barcode images back into
messages. Images are passed to dmtxread via standard input or
file, and the output is written to standard output. The following
examples will produce an equivalent result:

  $ dmtxread -n image.png
  $ cat image.png | dmtxread -n

Other typical cases:

  $ dmtxread -n -N1 image1.png image2.png image3.png
  $ dmtxread -n -N1 -m500 image.png

You can even combine the utilities like this:

  $ echo 'Hello, world!' | dmtxwrite | dmtxread
  Hello, world!

  $ dmtxread image1.png | dmtxwrite -o image2.png

Note: In this example the barcode in image2.png might appear
different than the one in image1.png. Both barcodes will encode
the same message, but the overall barcode shape and its internal
bit pattern might be different.
