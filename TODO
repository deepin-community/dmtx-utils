TODO Items
-----------------------------------------------------------------

version 1.0.0: (planned TBD)
FOCUS: remaining gaps, testing, documentation

version 0.9.0: (planned TBD)
FOCUS: refactor encoding engine, FNC1, macros
  o dmtxread:  Print character values (not just codewords) from --codewords (-c) option
  o dmtxread:  Print out image representing "unstretched" barcode
  o dmtxread:  Print color weights based on direction
  o dmtxread:  Diagnostic image shows tighter-fitting outline
  o dmtxread:  Change dmtxread to print out dump of both failed and successful barcodes if requested
  o dmtxread:  Change dmtxread to print out mis-read modules somehow ... additive, subtractive?
               - Build color vector that describes jump from background to foreground color
               - When module is determined to be "off" then add half of color vector
               - When module is determined to be "on" then subtract half of color vector
               - resulting image should clearly show misread modules
  o dmtxwrite: Use MagickCommentImage() to tag images with messages
  o dmtxwrite: Print character values (not just codewords) from --format=c (-fc) option
  o dmtxwrite: Verbose messages describing encoding process

version 0.8.0: (planned TBD)
FOCUS: region detection refinement, multiple barcode scanning, structured append
  o dmtxread:  Flatten deeply nested loops in main()
  o dmtxread:  Add true scan timings that factor in linking, startup, image load
  o dmtxwrite: Add support for setting foreground and background colors
  o dmtxwrite: Consider adding "--strict" for single scheme requests (or make strict default?)
  o dmtxquery: Write XML for dmtxquery consumption
  o dmtxquery: Initial working version (parses XML)
  o project:   Add missing getopt_long files
  o project:   Version numbers should be maintained separate from library
  o project:   Consider --disable-magick, while providing native PNM support to utils
  o project:   Any way to ask Magick to filter out GS (and other) warnings?
  o project:   Conditional use of local getopt.c
